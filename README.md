# Facial-Verification
Face verification software is a type of biometric software that uses facial recognition technology to verify the identity of an individual. 
It works by comparing the facial features of an individual to a previously recorded image or template, such as a government-issued ID or a passport.
The software typically involves the following steps:

Capture an image: The system captures an image of the individual's face using a camera or a webcam.

Preprocessing: The image is preprocessed to ensure that it is of high quality and to remove any noise or distortions.

Feature extraction: The system extracts facial features from the image, such as the distance between the eyes, the shape of the nose and mouth, 
and the curvature of the jawline.

Comparison: The extracted features are compared to a previously recorded image or template to determine whether the individual's face matches the reference image.

Verification: If the comparison is successful, the individual's identity is verified, and they are granted access to the system or application.

#To Note 
I've included a jupyter file which i used to preprocess my images, gather my datasets and train my artificial model(i was unable to upload my trained model and datasets 
because of git hub size limit).
